# gitmostwanted
Advanced explore of github.com. The main goal is to highlight the most interesting repositories and exclude others. You can find some concepts in the [Wiki](https://github.com/kkamkou/gitmostwanted.com/wiki).

If you would like to help the project, please consider these topics:
- GMW uses [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing) and the service is pretty expensive.
- GMW is located on a private machine and hosted by [ProfitBricks](https://www.profitbricks.de/).

## Run (Python3)

```bash
# export PYTHONPATH="`pwd`:${PYTHONPATH}"
# export GMW_APP_ENV=production
cp instance.cfg.distr /path/to/instance.cfg
export GMW_APP_SETTINGS=/path/to/instance.cfg
python gitmostwanted/web.py
```

## Tests

```bash
export GMW_APP_ENV=testing
pip install pytest pytest-pep8 responses
py.test --pep8 gitmostwanted tests/unit
# py.test --pep8 --cov . --cov-report annotate gitmostwanted tests/unit
```

## Docker
